Michelle Zauner talks about growing up as one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother‚Äôs particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother‚Äôs tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food.

‚Ä¶and the r/bangtan Mod Team",3715,1,34,7,"[{'comment_id': 'ka9k009', 'comment_body': 'I haven‚Äôt participated in a book discussion until now, so if this isn‚Äôt the format or the right place, please let me know!\n\nThis book made me feel way too many things. Honestly, it brought my anxiety to the front. So my biggest fear is losing people I know, and I am blessed (and cursed) with extremely vivid imagination. I can picture things on ultra HD mode. So I just had to put the book down a lot of times because it was too disturbing.\n\nInitial impressions‚Ä¶ honestly the first couple of chapters I just didn‚Äôt like the mom and her high handed ways. I kept siding with Michelle‚Äôs rebellious side. As I kept reading, I began to empathize with her mom. The high pressure, high expectations‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs an Asian (I mean the continent not just East Asian people) trait, but my family is always conscious about what society would say. I‚Äôm always judged by my looks, my style of talking, whether I‚Äôm successful or not.. lord during the first couple of Michele‚Äôs rebellious descriptions I just kept going ‚Äúgood for her‚Äù. It‚Äôs just so hard to be at the receiving end of someone‚Äôs love when it is SO controlled and SO meticulous. I found myself being frustrated every time Michele described herself being frustrated.. ugh.\n\nThat line where she talks about how her mum could make her feel ugly or the most beautiful person‚Ä¶ it is SO true. I had to sit down and tell my mom one day that every time she criticized something about the way I looked or dressed, it chipped away a little bit of my self esteem‚Ä¶ and thankfully she understood.\n\nAs for loss.. the very first chapter where she mentions being annoyed with people for being able to function normally whilst she‚Äôs so sad.. I think that was the best way to capture that feeling of helplessness. I lost one of my best friends as a teen, my grandparents quite recently. And I remember being angry with everybody. And I mean EVERYBODY. I hated the way people would talk around me, hated when they would lower their volume, hated that they pitied me, hated that they didn‚Äôt pity me, loathed it when people who knew the ones I lost would say ‚Äúoh he was a good person‚Äù.. well how do they know? How does ANYBODY quantify or qualify ‚Äúgood‚Äù? Their definition is probably different from somebody else‚Äôs definition of it. \n\nSorry I‚Äôm rambling, but these were some of the things I thought of whilst reading the book. üòÄ', 'comment_upvotes': 8, 'length_of_comment': 2370, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kaa4lws', 'comment_body': ""This is also my first time contributing to the book discussion. JK is the one who inspired me to get this book months ago but  I only finished reading it a month and a half ago.  I'll try and do my best to remember.\n\n*Food and family...* I think this is a familiar concept at least in my family/culture.  Food is a big part of how you connect with other people.  It's more common to say 'Have you eaten?' when greeting someone as opposed to 'How are you?' in many other cultures.\n\n*Initial impressions*...\\*First impression was 'Wow, this is going to be heavy!'  I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to finish it but I did it... eventually.  I don't particularly books which revolve around the passing of a love one.\n\n*Heritage...* I think this struggle is something that is common for a lot of people regardless of whether your parents are from the same or different cultural background. Both my parents are South-east Asian but I grew up in Australia and it was always like.. well, what am I?  Of course, as I've grown older, I know who am but it's not uncommon for people to try and attach labels to people by asking them where they're from and what background they're from.    I've also tried to connect more with my heritage in the past few years by trying to learn the language and travelling around the country.\n\nI heard that they were turning this into a movie so I'd be interested to see it now that I've read the book."", 'comment_upvotes': 6, 'length_of_comment': 1431, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kabiuvm', 'comment_body': ""On the book itself. I‚Äôd slept on this book for a while, perhaps because it was too hyped up. I rarely read biographies, and it‚Äôs rare to see a book appear in the New Yorker and Teen Vogue simultaneously. For some reason that made me ignore it more. I really shouldn‚Äôt have.\n\n**Food and identity**\n\nZauner‚Äôs style was casual, but deft - she captures scenes, tastes, sounds, personalities in a few lines. The pacing of the book was fast and it had a lot of heart and humor for the subject matter. The intro piece was flawless. I like leaning into the absurdity of life - sometimes we overdramatize our pain and sever it from laughter and everyday awkwardness. I don‚Äôt like that - embracing it all is somehow more human, more attached to reality, sharper maybe?\n\nIt made me think - about food, and people I‚Äôve lost, and the ways I feel distant from my own country and culture.\n\nI‚Äôm from the Balkans, and it‚Äôs marked me. I lived there until I was 14. I‚Äôm more from there than anywhere, I suppose. But teenage years in America changed me and adulthood in Western Europe changed me. Yet, there‚Äôs something about being home that relieves a particular type of anxiety I didn‚Äôt even know I possessed. It‚Äôs something about how shopkeepers are mean and kind at the same time, or how it‚Äôs easy to warm up on cold days. The bits in Seoul reminded me of that, that recognition of returning to the ancestral home. I rejected it for a long time, not because I wanted to be American, but rather because I didn‚Äôt want to be anything. I was uncomfortable with the concept of patriotism, or the notion that one culture can somehow be more special than another. I guess I was missing the point which is that each one is special, and that‚Äôs a thing to be cherished, uniquely separate from comparison. I wonder though, if like Zauner, what I was trying to do is recontextualize my identity through the world around me, and as that world changed, so did I.\n\nAnyhow, I miss the food of my childhood, it feels far from me these days. Crying in H Mart brought it right back, even though the tastes and ingredients were different - I could taste home. I never learned how to cook well - I‚Äôm almost Namjoon-level clumsy in the kitchen. And like Zauner‚Äôs family, my grandmother also doesn‚Äôt give instructions. Sour and salt is what I remember. Greasy rice. Sour cabbage (ours isn‚Äôt spicy like kimchi, but often turns out neon pink which is pretty cool). She made me feel, especially in that opening chapter - she captured the feeling of getting close to something important, something that ties pain and culture and family and comedy and history into one. I don‚Äôt usually cry with books, and I can say I made it mostly through the entire thing without shedding tears, but the first chapter had me going.\n\nI also really liked her journey afterwards, how she began to cook, began to create the things that will tie her closer to her mother - I found that both relatable and inspiring. The scene where she makes soup for herself after coming back from Vietnam and states that it felt like the first time she was full - it showed the significance of food in a different way, tied both to memory but also as a tactic for survival and overcoming grief, as a practice that allows you to keep a piece of the person you miss in perpetuity.\n\nMore than anything, the book made me want to go home for a bit, reminded me why it‚Äôs important. To eat, mostly. But also to feel near the family I see rarely, family that won‚Äôt always be there. Christmas is coming up and it‚Äôs making me dream of buttery potatoes and grape leaves stuffed with wild mushrooms and thyme and lots and lots of pickled cabbage. I don‚Äôt know. I was always going to go home but after reading this I bought my ticket a week early.\n\n**Loss**\n\nIt‚Äôs funny. I voted for Human Acts in the poll, an indescribably heavy book. One of my favorite books. Yet this, unexpectedly, felt heavier to me.\n\nI lost my best friend to cancer two years ago. Some days it still feels fresh. Like a wound that will always only be able to scab, but will never completely heal over. It‚Äôs a strong scab but even picking at a corner will occasionally start the bleeding again. Often at surprising times, triggered by the most inane and everyday things. That‚Äôs all to say, I miss him and this brought some of it back.\n\nZauner captured it well. In short strokes it felt raw, again, but not in a way that was painful, but more like a mirror - a recognition of pain and all the strange ways it can take shape, the ways it can become tangled in the everyday and significant through small rituals - a meal or a song. It‚Äôs a mark of an exceptionally self aware writer. I like how she didn‚Äôt end with the funeral - I initially thought that she would, but began focusing on the messy bits that come after, and how they‚Äôre not all 100% grief, but more like trying to place oneself into a new reality that will forever be different from the previous, how to build up a life afterwards and how to retain closeness and significance to the life before. I think the word honesty gets thrown around a lot in biographies, but it fits well here. She writes well, and she writes with honesty. That's a lot of words to say I really liked it - but yeah, I really liked it."", 'comment_upvotes': 4, 'length_of_comment': 5250, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kafbtxk', 'comment_body': '""Save your tears for when your mother dies."" Crying in H-mart is an apt title. I was crying in h-mart, on the trail, stuck in traffic, doing dishes...anywhere I was listening to the audiobook. The was a very emotional read for me, for a lot of reasons.\n\nFirst the personal: Many years ago, I lost my older sister to leukemia. Michelle\'s descriptions of the process of dealing with terminal illness in a loved one resonated with me on a level I didn\'t expect. From remembering exactly where she was and what she was doing when she heard the news to the feelings of helplessness and wishing she could take her mother\'s pain. I felt all of that in my bones. How her relationship with her dad changed after her mother\'s death hit me right in the chest. Death changes the living, and Michelle really described how in a way that not a lot of people can do, in my opinion. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve read a book that I related to in some way, not to mention a deep way. I\'m grateful this was the pick this month.\n\nNext...THE FOOD. The way Michelle described each dish made me ravenous to try them, especially the Korean dishes. One of the things I love most about Korean culture is the way they express love through food. ""Have you eaten?"" Such a simple thing to say ""I love you"" and ""Are you doing okay?"". Throughout all of the ups and downs between Michelle and her mom, it seemed like food always brought them together. A lot of the dishes seemed like the ultimate comfort food, especially the warm, simple things prepared for umma as she went through her illness. \n\nAt first, reading about how her mother showed her love made me feel sad for Michelle. What did she say...there\'s tough love and then there\'s brutal, industrial strength love, and that felt sad. So different from how I grew up. But as she described further that one way her mom would express love was to remember the little things people like, the things that brought them joy, it made me think more about the different ways a mother loves her child and the ways a child feels that love. My mom changed a lot after my sister died. She became a lot harsher. But she was showing me love with the demands and over worrying and harsh words, just in a different way from when I was little. Reading this book really made me think about that and appreciate it in a way I haven\'t before. \n\nCrying In H-mart is a really heavy read at times, and a soft, sweet read at others. It\'s been on my list for a while, and I\'m glad this was the push for me to finally read it. I think it truly loosened something in me I didn\'t realize was tight, and helped me look at my relationship with my own mom in a different light. Michelle is an accomplished writer and I was so impressed with the details she remembered. She\'s very good at describing things in a lush way without it feeling flowery, especially the food, and it made the read (or listen) enjoyable, even with the heavy subject matter.\n\nOh, and I chose the lamb that represents love, and I don\'t know how I feel about that.\n\nLooking forward to reading everyone\'s thoughts on this thoughtful, heartbreaking, well-written book.', 'comment_upvotes': 4, 'length_of_comment': 3132, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kagv2kx', 'comment_body': 'Hi, friends! I‚Äôd love to say that I enjoyed Crying in H-Mart, but that‚Äôs too simplistic for the range of emotions I felt as I read, I think. \n\nIt‚Äôs a tremendous book, extremely vivid and immersive. Michelle‚Äôs full-throttle approach to being vulnerable and honest regarding difficult topics was very engaging, but it also made me cry, so. There‚Äôs that.\n\nI think Michelle taps into something really universal when she describes her family (especially her mom) showing love through food. While there are differences from culture to culture, preparing and sharing meals with family and friends is a tangible way to show our love. In my family, our love at the table is expressed by abundance of choice: there‚Äôs never enough room for everything, but always a few things that everyone likes.\n\nFrom Michelle‚Äôs struggle to reconcile her Korean heritage and her American heritage, I learned that it can take a long time to find a way to bring all the parts of yourself together and feel good about how you present yourself to the world. \n\nDo I have any lingering questions? Yes. Does anyone have insight on what happened with Kye and specifically, how she left? Do you think she just reached her breaking point in tragic circumstances? I wish Kye and Michelle could have come to a place of understanding.\n\nHave I ever lost someone close to me? Yes. My grandpa, and my best friend‚Äôs dad. Did Michelle‚Äôs descriptions of grief resonate with me? Yes. In particular, her description of anticipatory grief struck me. ‚ÄúFor the rest of my life there would be a splinter in my being, stinging from the moment my mother died until it was buried with me.‚Äù I grieved my grandpa long before he died due to his Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, but since his funeral was on my birthday, every birthday from 2020 until I die will be a celebration with that memory in mind. \n\n~Giveaway Questions~\n\nWhere did Michelle sleepover once a week? At her friend Nicole‚Äôs apartment. Did I have a sleepover friend? I had two! From the time we were 12 until we graduated high school, my friends and I had regular sleepovers, though not every week. It was every month or so and always on birthdays.\n\nWhich animal do both Michelle and her mother pick from Eunmi‚Äôs game? They choose the monkey, their baby. Which would I choose? I chose the horse, and I love my work, so this makes some sense. Although I will say almost anyone who plays these games with me asks far more questions than Michelle does. ‚ÄúAre the animals restrained?!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow long is the journey?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow far between are the stops?‚Äù Etc etc. \n\nWhich actress do they watch on Inside the Actor‚Äôs Studio? They watch Mariska Hargitay speak of her mother‚Äôs death and cry together. Is there a show, movie or book I use to distract myself from what is happening? When distraction is the goal, I turn to books. I prefer mysteries because there‚Äôs a puzzle to solve. I watch the show Psych for similar reasons and Studio Ghibli movies are immersive and comforting at the same time. \n\nThanks to everyone participating here! I‚Äôm glad you have been willing to share your stories, insights and perspectives. I‚Äôve been reading them all, and I think our discussion has been particularly meaningful this time around.', 'comment_upvotes': 3, 'length_of_comment': 3207, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kabirhl', 'comment_body': ""Wow, what a day for a book club huh? I finished it this morning and it's a nice distraction from today's news. Apologies ahead of time if overly emotional and overly long (two-comments long!) üò≠üò≠üò≠\n\n**Giveaway Questions**\n\n* Michelle was allowed to stay over at one friend‚Äôs house while growing up, what is the name of that friend? Did you have a friend‚Äôs home that you often slept over at growing up?\n\nNicole and her mom Colette. As an immigrant child, this bit resonated with me - the constant push and pull between cool, American suburban families who seemed to befriend their children and my mother who, full of love and strict intention, had different warmth. Tough love. Most of my friends were similar - we gathered ourselves along the lines of where we were from, where our parents were from. At the time, we didn‚Äôt think much of it - we weren‚Äôt consciously othering ourselves, nor do I feel like we were particularly aware of being othered by others (although we might have been, at least to some extent). I‚Äôd just moved to the US at 14 and I found that, despite being in a very all-American neighborhood, my friends were Mexican, Salvadorian, Chinese, Filipino, Indian‚Ä¶We had funny accents, strict moms, high GPA expectations, and few sleepovers. Yet. We snuck out of the house to hang out and would make studying excuses for one another when we got in trouble. We rarely went to parties, but snuck beers in neighborhood parks and called on an endless array of big brothers and cousins to give us rides home before curfew. And we all felt uncomfortable, or a bit strange, when placed in no-rules friendly American households. Thinking of it now, it feels normal. Back then, I guess what I was thinking was - how do they have it so easy?\n\n* In the book, Eunmi poses the thought of going on a journey with five animals (lion, horse, cow, monkey, lamb), which animals do Michelle and her mother pick? Which animal would you pick?\n\nThey both ended up with the monkey, the baby. I would pick the lamb. Mostly to protect and cherish it, and because they‚Äôre soft. It‚Äôs meant to mean love. I suppose I see that, both in the significance of the lamb and in myself as a hopeless romantic. There‚Äôs something in the delicate nature of keeping love alive and the youth of it that tracks.\n\n* Michelle talks about her and her mother watching an episode of Inside the Actor‚Äôs Studio while her mother is sick. Who is the actress featured in the episode? Is there a show, movie, music or book that you use to distract you from things happening in the world?\n\nMariska Hargitay. I‚Äôve also not heard of her. I thought it was interesting how, rather than comforting, they watched something that instead of supportive was cathartic. It seems like they needed it, both Zauner and her mother, who for most of her illness does not seem to have the opportunity for a release or to face the facts or the future. A tough love continued. It felt important that they got this moment to cry and hold onto one another, to recognize what could happen.\n\nI think I have both - things that bring me back from anxiety, songs and records mostly and pieces that bring me catharsis. Sea is my safe place, it makes it easier to move forward, 2!3! too, the entirety of Mono which can singlehandedly bring me down from the edge of an anxiety attack, D-Day because future‚Äôs gonna be okay. Some tough days even watching them be silly for five minutes can bring a smile to my face and, rather than escape, bring comfort, perhaps a bit of strength to face the next day.\n\nBut catharsis is needed too. On that side, I‚Äôd pick Tim from the 80‚Äôs band the Replacements who are mostly known as the band that never got big, but should have. That record got me through heartbreak (more than once) and helped me grow up. I‚Äôve cried to it more times than I can count and even today, listening to it feels like recognition of a part of me, something that lives within and can be embraced with defiance. (Complete sidenote, but for any fans of 80‚Äôs punk out there, Tim just got remixed and re-released and the new versions sound so glorious, I‚Äôve been looping it non-stop over the last few days)."", 'comment_upvotes': 2, 'length_of_comment': 4143, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'kad8it9', 'comment_body': ""I just spent so long writing my comment and clicked a notification and forgot what I was doing and I lost it. üò≠üò≠ I will come back tomorrow with my thoughts as it's late already.

Her death was completely unexpected and I felt a lot of the same things that you and Michelle did.  I didn't know why others didn't have the same reaction as me.  I know that everyone grieves differently but to me is seemed insane that not everyone around me was completely devastated.  I honestly still get this overwhelming feeling of grief when I think about her sometimes (not all the time but it hits a few times a year).

Can we make the next 18 months go as fast somehow? It's been a rollercoaster. I remember being so anxious at the start of chapter 2 because it was unknown and also thinking I'd have loads of time to catch up. I never expected it to be as busy. It's hard, but I think my favorite thing has been Yoongi's tour. Not only because of how amazing the show itself was, but I just think as a fandom we really needed it. Even if you couldn't attend it was just exciting and happy whenever there was a show. I think it helped make us all feel more connected. Concerts are really where both they and us thrive and I don't think any of us really dreamed we'd get a tour until after the military. I also like that it gave a buffer to DDays release. I don't know if it makes sense, but knowing we had all that time after meant I could enjoy the album release more without fearing a 'Hello this is bighit' right after.  \n\nI could choose so many songs as my favorite and it changes all the time, but I think because it's today I'll go with Take Two. The hiatus news hit me hard and it kind of tainted both Yet to Come and For Youth for me because I just felt sad. I still struggle listening to them. Take two I enjoyed a lot more and it felt more warm and hopeful to me, so it meant a lot having a group song I could listen to without feeling sad.\n\nThere's just been so much and it's all been varied.

JitB has grown on me. And FACE, that album is just criminally short. Golden is such a beautiful listen, too. And when The Astronaut comes on, I just wallow in my feels. We have been so spoiled.\n\nAside from music and concerts, Suchwita has been such a comfort watch.

17zyzfj,Recommendation for BTS content to watch,"So, as I've been quite busy since the beginningof the year, I missed on quite a lot of content. I also still have to watch some content they released since the group began. There's so much, it's like it's impossible to catch up. üòÜ
But that's not a bad thing, because now j have so many choice of things to watch in my freetime.

Like I said, I was really busy recently and didn't have much time for myself.
Since we're almost at winter break, and I really want tk relaxe during that time, I thought I could catch up on some content.

If you have recommendations for what I cohld add on mh watching list, I will write it down on a piece of paper and I'll pick one paper per day.

What's your favorite Bangtan thing to watch when you want to relaxe ? It could be a Run BTS episode, or maybe a concert performance ? A documentary that you love ? A vlog ? A Bangtan Bomb behind the scene ? A variety show theh appeared in ?

Let me know what is your go to video for a good time !

Such a cool and unforgettable experience. The only bad thing is it was too short! Only an hour and a half. I know he did all his songs from Golden, but he could have kept singing more BTS songs, no one would have complained, haha. But I understand the point was to showcase the album. Seeing him perform all his new songs live, and some for the first time ever was so cool.\n\nI've been to 3 BTS concerts before (all in stadiums) and there was definitely a huge difference in the vibe, but in such a cool way. The stadium concerts are so big and have this larger-than-life unreal energy, but JK's concert tonight had such a nice, friendly, almost cozy vibe to it.\n\nI loved how when he was reading the fans' answers to his questions and then talking with Namjoon, there was such a palpable vibe of, we're all just hanging out. He did a lot of natural, unscripted interaction with the audience and the venue was small enough for there to be some real back and forth. Like I felt like I was in a BTS video, where they're just sitting there chatting and hanging out. It just felt really genuine. Just like in his lives it seemed like he wanted to make it go on for a long time and didn't want to say goodbye. He just seemed so happy.\n\nOverall, I just feel so blessed that I was able to attend this concert in-person. JK is such an amazing and genuine performer, and this is such an important and meaningful time in his life and career. And he's such a massive star, I mean, 6 million people will tune in just to watch him sleep, and as far as we know this is the only dedicated concert he's doing. Only 2800 people in the world got to be in that arena with him, and I was one of them, and the significance of that is not lost on me.\n\nOMG, I just finally opened the gift box we all got at the concert and he gave us a photo album and a disposable camera and chocolates.

I am now going through the Chapter 19 stories and man, after last night's Festa Dinner (a BTS real life event), playing through Chapters 18 to 19 hit differently. 

&#x200B;

*Spoilers ahead*

&#x200B;

These chapters are now talking about the recent years, 2020 to present. While I know that the stories are not what actually happened behind the scenes, they do take the broad strokes of what happened to BTS' career and make the players live those moments. So playing through the celebration of their 7th year anniversary when it was just their 9th year anniversary a few days ago, and now the thought process behind the release of Dynamite when last night, they confirmed that that song and what happened afterwards were not part of their original plan, but them just trying to make the best decision at that time, makes me feel a twinge in my heart.

I don't know what kind of roller coaster ride I'll go through as I play the rest of the chapters.

*After a few hours...*

I'm now playing through the last chapter. I'm now at the part where they are celebrating the 8th Festa. üò≠

u7jcld,Two Trackes; 6 level events and 50 level events : make predictions on how far you can get,"I have two trackers a 6 level tracker for things like Fly BTS and Springtime BTS that will calculate automatically for you what gems you need  and how much more you need for a prize every day.

All you need to do is fill in your daily DATA *in the yellow boxes*.  That's it.

The six level event one I adapted from Cat's tracker (link in the sheet).   I added a way to make gem predictions based on gems you have and gems you expect to get.

The second is for the 50 level events. I just made from scratch. I needed to know if investing gems in wings packs would let me break even and get 3 rounds this time (last time I did 2 rounds with no wings packs).  With this sheet I found that I got around almost 4.5 times by investing my gems in wings packs.  I invested 1150 gems and made a profit of 25 gems; got 3 five star 2 tier cards; and 20 4 star cards.  I earned 176 draw tickets!

All it requires is to fill in DAILY data in the *yellow input boxes.*  It will automatically tell you a lot of information. It also means you can fill in the data ahead of time to see what prize you can get by the end of the event and how many points you can get even if you can't get to the top and are a low level and FTP:

**It tells you automatically:**

* what round you are on (if you went around once, twice, etc...)
* if the gems you invested netted a profit, loss, or broke even
* how many tickets you won
* how many gems you won
* if you input the 4 and 5\* cards you got from tickets it will use that data to calculate all the stones/bouquets/flowers you earned
* it tells you how many times you completed a level
* it tells you how many wings you used
* it shows you the levels you completed the most often
* you can also keep track of what rounds you cleared with what points/stars (but that is optional it had no bearing on any data formulas) if you want to compare different events in the future
* a little ""what if"" box compares if you invested gems in the gem draw instead of the event.

This big one that\'s the best price for wings/gems.   The problem with this big pack at a low level is that you will fill your experience, but will lose the fill-up wings on level up.  All things considered, at your level it\'s not a big deal IMO.   But if you don\'t like that idea and want to have more control there are lower wings packs (2000 for 250 gems, 1000 for 100 gems, etc) so you can have better control of when and how you level up to use that refill. But... you will get fewer wings per gem. It\'s a trade-off.\n\nI know it is tempting to throw it all into a gem draw for better cards. It is my opinion that gem investment on level up makes much more sense in the beginning.  In contrast, if you use 200 gems to draw instead you could get only 3 star cards since you aren\'t guaranteed to get 4 star or 5 stars. It\'s pure luck. You have to decide which you think will get you the most benefit for the level you are now.***Once you get a better assortment of cards and more wings:***  If you invest 300 gems on wing pack purchase during an event like Together BTS and can get *at least* 5000 items (one time through) you will ""break even"" and get those gems back while you accumulate affinity and draw tickets.  This all depends on how high you can go, the higher you can go the more items will earn in a day.  I was able to go once around on this type of event at your level without a wing investment, but I had double wings membership got a really lucky roll call ALL MEMBERS ALL SKILLS +400 and so I got to climb to the top. So the higher you can get the better.\n\n**FREE PLAY EVENTS**The next focus should be on the events with the free plays like Fly BTS.  You want to buy as much DNA as possible so you can invest in a guaranteed 5 star card. If there is no good one in the shop, wait and keep accumulating DNA.  If you can get the 4 star selector or the 5 star that\'s great, if not *it\'s all about the DNA*\n\n**HOARD YOUR GOLD.** This is the best way to get a lot of cards. Other than the necessary card level ups and priority schedule for affinity, SAVE ALL YOUR GOLD for the special draw event that is specifically meant for the photo album completion.  This gold draw only pulls 1 to 4 star cards.  So without spending any gems, you will get 1 star cards  but are guaranteed a whole bunch of 3 star and at least a few 4\\* cards which all translate to DNA and Stones for free.\n\nI hope this helps.', 'comment_upvotes': 8, 'length_of_comment': 3702, 'num_emoticons': 0}, {'comment_id': 'i4u3mp8', 'comment_body': ""It's hard to say, I'm level 90 and maxed out many level 5 cards (I have 13-21 per member).

Besides, I didn't do this all the time, only when I was a few stones shy of getting a card upgraded. Like I mentioned earlier, my priority was saving gems rather than DNA and leveling up a card does give you gems.

The best 4 star cards you have with skewed stats can really get you over a level you are stuck on especially with a lucky wake-up call roll. They take fewer stones to upgrade than 5 stars or Tier 2 cards.I was lucky to get V's  4 star Mr. Curiosity card in the beginning and that passion stat on that is an insane at level 50 of 4,375.  Even at level 30 that card is invaluable.    3 star cards with a stat of at least 1848 are a good investment.

It is worth going as high as you possibly can on Another Story and the Main story so that you can replay the highest level to get the highest return of goods from wings.  You will be surprised how much gold, agency items, and flowers you can stockpile especially during rate up.\n3. Other than leveling up your best cards and using the agency, I suggest hoarding your gold coins for the special coin draw that comes up every few weeks.  It draws only cards for the photo album with a good rate on 3 and 4 star (100,000 for a 10 draw). This means that even if you get duplicate 4 stars or an orange wall of 3 star cards, that ends up being a LOT of stones, blossoms, and a decent amount of DNA over time without having to use gems.\n4. After the initial new player phase, I don't find most of the gem draws to be worth the pay out.  It's all about luck.   I have gotten pretty lucky and also drowned in RANK E luck.    The only gem draw I will now invest in are the SINGLE MEMBER draw. The reason is that even if I don't get a 5 star card I am more likely to draw a 4 star and lots of 3 stars with member specific stones, some DNA, and plenty of flowers.  Getting a 5 star is nice, but the primary goal is the stones. Not only that but the special will also fill your purple box needs.\n5. Another reason you want to be as card powerful as you possibly can is so that you can get at least one card from a card event (or be able to buy as much event DNA as possible), so you want to be able to climb as high as possible.  Or for the special items event you want to get those free 200 gem gifts, tickets, and 4 star selectors.  If you are pay-to-play save those gems specifically to get a 5 star.  If you are relying on free gems you want to gather as many free resources as possible and accumulate gems for a big payday.\n6. Another story 2  As soon as you are able invest some wings here because it can take an exceedingly long time to accumulate the items to upgrade a tier 2 card.  It takes a lot of wishing keys. I suggest at the start to purchase as much as possible when you see that an item is 30% off or better.  It may not seem like much, but it makes a big difference and what works against you is not only wings but time. So invest a little early and often. You can refresh the item shop for free every four hours.\n7. Other than leveling up during the special rate level up events, spend some time replaying another story 1.  Get those 5 star card pieces.  You can only get 6 pieces per day, per member and it takes 48 wings per member.  It takes 17 days to be able to get enough to craft a 5 star card, but you can exchange it for 70 stones, 10 bouquets, and 120 DNA.  That means, that as you level up and get more wings and you can manage to do all 7 members almost once month that would give you 840 DNA to spend in the DNA shop.\n8. IF you are a low level then wings are always in short supply.  So it is worth level up ASAP.IF you are a pay-to-play and have the monthly membership then you might consider spending gems during the special wings shop sale and save them for the special experience rate-up level event (3000 wings for 300gems, 2000 wings form 250 gems, 1000 wings for 150gems...)  Yes, I know big investment BUT IMO wings are a slow resource and it is worth leveling up fast.  I managed to go up 5 levels during the last exp level rate up event just by investing my gems in wings instead of a gem draw. This had a HUGE impact on my daily wings, and I am now able to invest more wings on crafting cards and wishing keys. I also don't have to log in as often for fear of losing wings because it's full.   This wing investment gave me more return (I am level 67 now) than to spend it on a gem draw that does not guarantee a 5\\*.

You can **put in your highest bonus you get every day** for each level (For example on day one on on level 2 you get 18 bonus items, and level 3 you get 20 bonus items etc)  and it will make predictions on what you will earn at the end of the 14 days even if you forget to fill it in every day (it won't be as accurate of course).

There is also a spot where you can **fill in the total FREE bonuses you got for the day**.  For example, day 1 you got 100 items from the free draw plus 100 from a log-in bonus so you input 200 for that day, and on day 7 maybe you earned 500 items from the quiz event.

There is still **a place to keep short notes** like the original tracker.

You can also **select the prize you want** and it will predict how many gems you will need even if you can only earn a low prize or if you want to see the gem insanity of going for the last prize.
